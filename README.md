# About
Don't use me, I'm a customized version of Bene for the use of streaming data
for [OneTrueCaptain](https://twitch.tv/OneTrueCaptain) on Twitch. This will never
be merged back into main line. I have it here in case people are curious about
the customizations I've done.

This version has some curl code added to submit the updated data points to a server
I have that powers a lot of cool stuff for the stream.
